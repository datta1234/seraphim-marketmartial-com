        <p class="card-text text-center">
            With as many brokers as there are banks, the question has always stood: How does a broker create edge, or how does a broker provide a service that truly is superior to all the rest?
        </p>
        <p class="card-text text-center">
            After 7 years of managing Investec Bankâ€™s Index and Single Stock Options trading books, with the necessary experience and expertise gained in this very niche market, I believe Market Martial is the answer to that question, and more.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text text-center">
            I can truthfully say that Market Martial has been custom built exclusively for derivatives traders, by a derivatives trader.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text text-center">
            The simple intention behind Market Martial has been to address all the inefficiencies I have experienced over the years by fast forwarding an old-fashioned market practice into the technical age, by utilising the numerous benefits of a state of the art electronic platform.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text text-center">
            Although the intention may have been simple, building a business around a platform that needs to cater to the many intricacies required to efficientize a relatively complex market has been anything but. I can only hope that our hard work and commitment has resulted in a product that you will find as useful as it is intended to be.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text text-center">
            With you, the derivatives traders, being the core focus of the Market Martial platform, I encourage you to provide me with your comments and critiques that could further improve your trading experience.
